# Quant Autoresearch Harness

An LLM-assisted autonomous quantitative research platform.

The system separates responsibilities:

```text
LLM = research direction and interpretation
LOCAL = IR mutation, planning, analysis, and persistence
WORKER = isolated backtest execution
EVALUATOR = immutable statistical judgment
MEMORY = experiment and knowledge accumulation
```

Research is separate from KIS order execution. Live trading is denied by default and requires a separate, explicit human approval gate.

## Development

This repository targets Python 3.10+ and uses pytest, Ruff, and mypy. Install the development dependencies from `pyproject.toml`, then run:

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
ruff check .
python -m mypy .
```

The approved architecture and the complete implementation plan are in `docs/architecture/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
